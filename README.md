# JSH

My attempt creating my own linux command line shell.

## Checklist
- [x] Simple shell behaviour
- [x] Editing commands using left and right arrows, backspace, and delete. 
- [ ] Proper command parsing (not just based on spaces)
- [ ] Proper job creation (e.g multiple jobs each with subcommands, redirection, etc)
- [ ] Command history using a local file like zsh's .zsh_history
